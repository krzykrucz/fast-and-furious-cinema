# In-memory storage

## Status

Accepted

## Context

1. The first iteration of the system must be created quickly
2. System has a Modular Monolith architecture
3. Every module needs to persist some data

## Decision

All persistence will be done in-memory with Kotlin structures, but only until the system goes live.

## Consequences

Pros
* fast development in the beginning
* good performance

Cons
* can't go live with this solution
* good for small amounts of data
