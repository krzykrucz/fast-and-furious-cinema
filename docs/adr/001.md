# Modular monolith architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

1. During Event Storming discovery, three separate subdomains emerged: catalog, showtimes and ratings.
2. It should be easy to extend any of these 3 domains functionalities in the future.
3. Architecture should allow quick creation of system's first iteration.
4. The load of the system will be low in the beginning.

## Decision

Backend system will follow a Modular Monolith architecture pattern.

## Consequences

Pros
* fast development in the beginning
* it'll be easy to extract modules as separate deployment units in the future
* better performance under small load

Cons
* data duplication
* harder to keep data consistency
