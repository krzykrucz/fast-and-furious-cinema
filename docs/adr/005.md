# Testing

## Status

Accepted

## Context

1. The first iteration of the system must be created quickly
2. System has a Modular Monolith architecture
3. Every module needs to persist some data and publish events
4. Production code is in Kotlin
5. Production code will be FP-oriented (gives a lot compile-time safety)

## Decision

1. Module behaviour-driven functional end-to-end tests (Kotest)
2. Architecture test (ArchUnit)
3. No unit tests
4. No contract tests

Evaluate after some time and migrate to unit tests if needed.

## Consequences

Pros
* fast development
* good confidence that features work
* Kotest is popular

Cons
* hard maintanance
* long execution
