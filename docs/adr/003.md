# Language & framework

## Status

Accepted

## Context

1. It has to be Kotlin/Java/Scala
2. MVP developer has best experience in Kotlin
3. Project is a small modular monolith
4. Integration with a database and event bus will be needed
5. API must be documented with Swagger

## Decision

1. Kotlin for a language
2. Ktor for a framework
3. Kotlin package as a module representation

## Consequences

Pros
* fast development in the beginning (Ktor is a simple framework, package structure is simple)
* there are libraries for Ktor to integrate with most common databases and message brokers
* full support for non-blocking asynchronous code (Kotlin coroutines)
* Relatively good support for functional programming
* Packages can be transformed into gradle modules in the future if needed
* Ktor is a number one server-side framework for Kotlin
* Ktor provides support application events (it can be used for in-memory event bus)

Cons
* data duplication
* Ktor lacks some out-of-the-box functionalities that Spring has (like Spring Data, Swagger integration)
* Ktor is less popular than Spring
* Kotlin is less popular than Java for server-side
