### User stories

User stories are created during an Event Storming session, by forming use-case flows out of Event Storming stickies. 

Each use case flow is accompanied by a set of business terms definitions. Every business term can be described in a specific context by one of three mathematical constructs:
* Term = A (means that Term is something else, e.g. Age **is a** number bigger than 0)
* Term = A & B & ... (means that Term is a couple of things at once, e.g. Money is amount **and** currency unit)
* Term = A | B | ... (means that Term is one of couple other things, e.g. Fruit is either Apple **or** Orange **or** yet sth else)
